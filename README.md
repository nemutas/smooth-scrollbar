[Vertical Scroll](https://nemutas.github.io/smooth-scrollbar/vertical/)<br>
[Horizontal Scroll](https://nemutas.github.io/smooth-scrollbar/horizontal/)

This repository has experimented with a combined implementation of [Smooth Scroller](https://idiotwu.github.io/smooth-scrollbar/) and [gsap](https://greensock.com/)'s [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger).

To pin with scrollTrigger, set pinType to transform. (For Touch Device, set it to fixed.)

The only thing that could not be done was horizontal scrolling on smart phones... ;<
